# nvidia-rapids-vs-sklearn
 
This notebook shows the speed difference between using Sklearn (Pandas, Numpy, ML libraries) vs Rapids.

The syntax is generally similar (most of the time), users could literally import different libraries but improve the speed of data processing and model fitting significantly using GPU.
